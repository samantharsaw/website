        <p>A couple of months ago I went on a visual web and interface design training course.</p>
                    
        <p>One of the tasks was to come up with as many alternatives you could think of for a slider component.</p>
          
        <p>I could think of some ideas but I didn’t sketch any of them out. I’d already decided in my head that they would never work, getting rid of my ideas before I’d even had a chance to draw them out.</p>
        
        <p>When I’d completed the task I’d sketched nothing but simple radio buttons with a yes or no answer. Whereas the other people on the course had lots of alternatives sketched out.</p>
            
        <p>The alternatives they came up with might never actually be used. But there’s value in sketching them out as there might be a good idea that comes out of a bad idea.</p>

        <p>Since going on the visual web and interface design course I’m trying to stop being so critical of myself and my ideas.</p>
        
        <p>Don’t limit yourself and your creativity. Let yourself have bad ideas.</p>
