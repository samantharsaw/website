<p>I’ve just started a new discovery project, away from the NHS App.</p>
    
<p>Because of this I’ve been writing up handovers to pass the work I was owning onto my colleagues.</p>

<p>For some of the work I’ve found it really difficult to let go of it.</p> 

<p>I feel like this must be quite a common thing for designers.</p> 

<p>You spend so long getting your head around a problem, doing the work to understand your user’s needs, spending hours prototyping and testing.</p> 

<p>For me, it’s hard to not get engrossed by a problem. So much that you want so badly to see the right decisions get made.</p>

<p>But for my own self-care, I have to stop expecting myself to always be in control and remember I can still be involved to answer questions and help out. I need to keep reminding myself that it’s ok to let go of work.</p>
