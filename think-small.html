          <p>A couple of weeks ago I was preparing my prototype for testing in a usability lab.</p>

          <p>I was exploring designs for how we might improve how we display users’ prescription orders.</p>

            <p>The existing design grouped orders by their status, from requested, to approved and finally, rejected.</p>

            <p>This potentially creates a long list of orders, and means that rejected orders always appear at the bottom of the list.</p>

            <p>So I wanted to see how else I could display prescription orders and improve the current design as much as I could before the usability lab.</p>

          <p>I was putting a lot of pressure on myself to solve a big design problem in no time. Rather than taking smaller steps by testing the current design to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>validate or invalidate my hypotheses</li>
                <li>find out what I needed to change</li>
             </ul>

            <p>Don’t put pressure on yourself to quickly come up with a perfect solution. Because you’ll never know if you’re solving a problem until you put your design in front of users.</p>
