  <p>Getting design work ready for development is often referred to as ‘handing over’ work. This implies that designers and other user-centred design professionals are no longer involved in that work and perpetuates a siloed way of working. I want to work collaboratively with developers during the build phase, not chuck something over the fence and never see it again.</p>

  <p>Getting work ready for development can be done in a variety of ways, but whatever you prefer, lacking a consistent approach could mean you risk leaving out important details. If something is missed, your team may not meet its sprint goals or may need to raise a bug to rectify the issue. This will end up causing more work for both the designers and the developers.</p>

  <p>Designers should be able to get involved early on in refining tickets and working on acceptance criteria, alongside people such as business analysts, technical architects, product owners and managers.</p>

  <p>I’ve recently worked on a template to help me make sure I don’t miss anything in my ready for development documentation:</p>

       <h2>Description of work</h2>

  <p>In my experience developers appreciate getting an understanding of why they’re being asked to do a piece of work. To articulate this you can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user needs</li>
  <li>the problems you’re trying to solve</li>
  <li>the intended outcome of doing the work</li>
  <li>links to any research or design reports that give more context</li>
</ul>


        <h2>Design artefacts</h2>
 
<p>What design artefacts to include depends on your prototyping tool of choice and the complexity of the work you’ve been doing, but can include links to:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>your prototype (if it’s hosted online, be sure to include any usernames or passwords)</li>
  <li>images of user flows that show the journey</li>
  <li>videos of a demo of the prototype</li>
 </ul>

        <h2>Design rules</h2>
        <h3>Accessibility requirements</h3>

        <p>Make notes of any requirements such as:</p>
   <ul>     
     <li>heading structure and hierarchy (what should be H1, H2 and so on)</li>
     <li>fieldsets and legends</li> 
     <li>visually hidden text</li>
     <li>alt text</li>
     <li>making sure terms are read out properly by screenreaders</li>
   </ul>

        <h2>Error handling and data catalogue</h2>

<p>If it’s applicable to your design, include mock ups of how the design should behave in these scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>validation errors (for example a user has inputted an invalid date)</li>
      <li>empty states (for example a user has searched and got no results)</li>
      <li>end pages (such as service unavailable, page not found)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you’ve designed a form, you can provide a data catalogue for input fields, to give detail such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>what characters are accepted</li>
          <li>character limits</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Measuring success</h2>

     <p>Let developers know if you need any analytics in place in order to measure the success of the implemented design.</p>


        <h2>User stories</h2>

      <p>Include any user stories you’ve captured that explain the expected functionality or user needs.</p>

        <h2>Acceptance criteria</h2>

        <p>There are other templates you can use but I use the <a href="https://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story/">Given/When/Then template</a> to explain how the design should behave and what should happen when users interact with it.</p>

        <p>Don’t expect to have everything covered at this stage, as you can develop your acceptance criteria further with team members such as business analysts, developers and product owners.</p>



        <h2>During the development phase</h2>

        <p>It’s a good idea to include a design quality assurance stage in your workflow, so designers are included in signing off work.</p>

        <p>Using a consistent approach to getting work ready for development should make things easier not just for designers, but the rest of the team too.</p>
