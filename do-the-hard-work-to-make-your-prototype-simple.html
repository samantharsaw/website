        <p>I recently built a prototype ready to test for a usability lab. The prototype works but some of the code I wrote is a complete mess.</p>
                    
        <p>I ended up hard coding separate variables in one function. This meant could not easily change how these variables looked when printed on different screens.</p>
          
        <p>You could say “it’s just a prototype” so it doesn’t matter. A prototype doesn’t need production level code. This is true, but I’ll learn more by taking the time to refactor my prototype.</p>
        
        <p>Refactoring my prototype will help me to understand where I could save time by getting something to work in a smarter way. And understand where I could be writing code that’s much more flexible.</p>
            
        <p>In the long run this will help me to build more efficient prototypes.</p>

        <p>For example Andrew Duckworth, a Senior Designer in my team, built a function that will inject the current date, the previous date or enter a number to determine x days in the past.</p>
        
        <p>This function means we're able to future proof our prototypes instead of having to keep changing dates that we show in our prototypes.</p>

        <p>Taking the time to think about how you could write more efficient code will save you time.</p>
