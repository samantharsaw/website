        <p>I recently built a prototype ready to test for a usability lab. The prototype works but some of the code I wrote is a complete mess.</p>
                    
        <p>I ended up hard coding separate pieces of information in one function, including a link. On one page of the prototype I wanted the link to appear as just text without looking like a hyperlink. But the way I had coded the prototype meant I couldn't easily change how the link to appeared on different pages.</p>
          
        <p>You could say “it’s just a prototype” so it doesn’t matter. A prototype doesn’t need production level code. This is true, but I’ll learn more by taking the time to refactor my prototype.</p>
        
        <p>Refactoring my prototype will help me to understand where I could save time by getting something to work in a smarter way. And understand where I could be writing code that’s much more flexible.</p>
            
        <p>In the long run this will help me to build more efficient prototypes.</p>

        <p><a href="https://grillopress.github.io/">Andrew Duckworth</a>, a Senior Designer in my team, built a function that will show the user either the current date or the previous date. Or we can enter a number in the code, for example 30, to show a date that's 30 days in the past.</p>
        
        <p>This function means we're able to future proof our prototypes instead of having to remember to change the dates that we show to users in our prototypes.</p>

        <p>Taking the time to think about how you could write more efficient code will save you time.</p>
