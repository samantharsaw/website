<h1>Goose skirting the issue</h1>

<p>My boyfriend's brother had his 30th birthday party at a fancy restaurant. One of the mains on the menu was the goose skirt which I’d never heard of.</p>

<p>A few people at our table ordered the goose skirt and as the waitress took their order, she explained that the goose skirt was in fact beef.</p>

<p>She said that she had to let us know as the pub had had many disappointed guests in the past order the goose skirt expecting to be served goose.</p>

<p>Why didn’t the restaurant just say it was beef and not goose on the menu? Then the waiting staff wouldn’t have to give the same explanation every time they served a table.</p> 

<p>What if the waiting staff forgot to mention it was actually beef and a customer ordered it?</p>

<p>The restaurant probably wanted to make their food sound fancy. But they haven’t considered how they might embarrass customers who order it thinking they were getting something else.</p> 

<p>They’ve assumed that to eat at their restaurant you must be the kind of person who must know what a goose skirt is.</p> 

<p>It’s wrong to assume this knowledge. Just be clear and understandable to your customers.</p>

<p>A few weeks later me and my partner went for a drink at a pub and I had a look at the menu.</p> 

<p>Some mains on the menu had (A) next to them. Neither of us had seen (A) on a menu before next to a main.</p> 

<p>I googled to try and find out what (A) meant but found nothing.</p> 

<p>I tweeted about it but those who replied were just as confused as me. Suggestions on Twitter included alcohol or allergies.</p> 

<p>I’m still wondering what that (A) stood for.</p>
