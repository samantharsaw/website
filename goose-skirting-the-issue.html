<p>My boyfriend's brother had his 30th birthday party at a fancy restaurant. One of the mains on the menu was the goose skirt which I’d never heard of.</p>

<p>A few people at our table ordered it and as the waitress took their order, she explained that the goose skirt was in fact beef.</p>

<p>She said that she had to let us know as the pub had had many disappointed guests in the past order the goose skirt expecting to be served goose.</p>

<p>The restaurant should've just said it was beef and not goose on the menu. Then the waiting staff wouldn’t have to give the same explanation every time they served a table.</p> 

<p>The restaurant probably wanted to make their food sound fancy. But they haven’t considered how they might embarrass customers who order it thinking they were getting something else.</p> 

<p>They’ve assumed that to eat at their restaurant you must know what a goose skirt is.</p> 

<p>It’s wrong to assume this knowledge. Just be clear and understandable to your customers.</p>

<p>I noticed that other places have bad menu design as well when a few weeks later my boyfriend and I went for a drink at a pub.</p> 

<p>Some mains on the menu had (A) next to them. Neither of us had seen (A) on a menu before next to a main.</p> 
          
<p>The menu gave no indication whatsoever as to what the (A) stood for.</p>

<p>I googled to try and find out what (A) meant but found nothing.</p> 

<p>I tweeted about it but those who replied were just as confused as me. Suggestions on Twitter included alcohol or allergies.</p> 

<p>I’m still wondering what that (A) stood for.</p>
