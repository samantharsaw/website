    <p>A long car journey a few weekends ago led to a trip to McDonald’s.</p>

    <p>This was my first McDonald’s since going vegan in January so I wasn’t sure what I’d be able to eat.</p>

    <p>I had a look on google and found I could eat the veggie burger as long as I asked for it to be made without the mayonnaise. Next I checked the fries and ended up on their FAQs and a modal popped up about if their fries were vegan.</p> 

    <p>Here’s the content:</p>
          
    <img src="https://github.com/samanthasaw/samantha-saw-blogs/blob/master/are%20your%20fries%20suitable%20for%20vegans.PNG" alt="Are McDonald's fries suitable for vegans web content">

    <p>The first sentence doesn’t answer my question at all. They say whether their fries are suitable for vegans in the last sentence. This is quite a lot of words to read when ‘yes’ would’ve done the same job. I wondered why they’d put the most important information at the end.</p> 

    <p>I couldn’t help but think there was an easier way to specify which of their products were suitable for vegans. Maybe a bullet list? Rather than separate FAQs for each product.</p>
