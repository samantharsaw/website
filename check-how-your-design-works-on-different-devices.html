    <p>A few weeks ago I sold some shoes on the shopping app Depop. </p>

    <p>After I had posted the shoes, I had the option to provide the buyer with some details. </p>

    <p>I have an iPhone SE. It’s a lot smaller than most smartphones.</p> 

    <p>This meant that I couldn’t see what details I was being asked to provide:</p>
          
    <img src="depop image.PNG" width="600" alt="Screenshot from the depop app saying 'Shipped on: 14/11/2019' and asking the user for Shipping pro... and Tracking nu...">

    <p>I could only assume the second word. My best guess was:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Shipping provider</li>
      <li>Tracking number</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Rather than designing the service so the second word went onto the next line, there was an ellipsis.</p>

    <p>Which meant the design was not usable on my device. I wanted to give the buyer helpful details about shipping, but who knows if I provided the right details.</p> 

    <p>It's so important to stretch your design to make sure it works for everyone. My colleague <a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2019/12/05/stretch-your-design.html">Andrew wrote a great blog about this</a>.</p>

    <p>Make sure you check how your design works on different devices.</p>
