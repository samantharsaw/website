<p>Me and Andrew (interaction designer I work with) worked on ideas for our contact centre staff to quickly send people reports.</p>  

<p>We sketched out a flow on post it notes and he helped me to mock up the screens in code.</p>  

<p>I’m a beginner at creating prototypes in code so this was a great opportunity for me to improve my skills.</p> 

<p>The flow includes a screen where users select the type of reports they want to send.</p> 

<p>On the next screen we tell users they should have permission to create a report. By clicking continue the user creates a report.</p> 

<p>Andrew suggested adding a way for users to go back to the Select the report you want to send screen.</p> 

<p>If users could go back to this screen they could check or change which report types they’d selected.</p>

<p>He helped me to add a back to previous page link to the screen.</p> 

<p>After adding the back link I told him I’d add the same link to all of the other screens we’d built.</p> 

<p>But he stopped me and asked a very important question.</p> 

<p>What is the user need?</p> 

<p>Now I’d learnt how to add the back link I’d got ahead of myself.</p> 

<p>I assumed that all the screens needed a back link too because we’d added the link to the one screen.</p> 

<p>This was a big lesson for me as a graduate designer.</p>

<p>Always remember to ask yourself what is the user need. Don’t add complexity if there isn’t one.</p>
